#PyBplus
##An implementation of a B+ tree using pure python
***
This is a relatively simplistic implementation of a B+ tree data structure for a university course in database management. 
The directory and file structure have been pre-defined by the assignment itself, in addition to the stipulation of not being able to use external libraries such as numpy.
